## Description

On July 30, 2020, the Governor of Minnesota announced guidelines for school reopenings based on county-specific rates of coronavirus infection. The guidelines define thresholds for the total number of cases in the past 14 days per 10,000 people in a county, and map these thresholds to recommended modes of school attendance (all in-person, elementary in-person / high-school hybrid, etc.).

This Shiny app displays the key metric (total cases in the past 14 days per 10,000) for counties and school districts in Minnesota.
